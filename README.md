# Personal website
In this project the client asked us for a simple website to show the motorhomes they rented. The general idea is to give as much information as possible about their services, such as rates, seasons, services included. The development took a month and a half. I created a main page with general information, vehicles, rates and seasons. Each of these sections has a dedicated page with more information.

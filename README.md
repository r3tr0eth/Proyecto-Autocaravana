# Personal website

I'm Gaizka Jimenez, programmer. My background is in full stack development, 
and I'm currently working in a consulting company that provides professional 
consulting and project management services Web. I've been actively involved in the 
industry for four years, and from the first moment I started coding, it has become 
indispensable for me to improve every day. I am passionate about technology. 
And to be able to offer our clients a quality service based on experience and 
commitment is one of my priorities. My beginnings were with Java and later I learned
 HTML and CSS for the front-end, since I have always been attracted to this world. 
 I am currently starting my conversion to Web3 software development,
 a blockchain technology in which I strongly believe in.
